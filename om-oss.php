            <h1>About us</h1>
            <p>At SkySurprise, we believe the best adventures are the ones you never saw coming. <br> We’re a Swedish-based travel company with a passion for breaking the routine.
             Our mission? To help curious, spontaneous travelers experience the thrill of flying somewhere completely unknown — until they
             land. That’s right: when you book with us, you pick the dates, the departure airport, and your vibe (city, beach, nature...) — and we handle the rest. <br>

            Our team is made up of globe-trotters, logistics nerds, and experience designers who work together to plan unforgettable trips full of mystery and magic. 
            Each journey is tailored to match your preferences while keeping the final destination a secret — just the way we like it. <br>

            Whether you're traveling solo, with friends, or surprising someone you love, SkySurprise is here to make your next trip one to remember — even if you don’t know where it is yet. <br>

            Dare to fly without a plan? <br>
            Welcome aboard.</p>

            <h1>Our vision</h1>
            <p>We envision a world where spontaneity leads the way. <br>

            Our goal is to make travel more exciting, more meaningful, and a little less predictable. In a time when everything is instantly searchable, 
            we believe in the power of the unknown — 
            in the thrill of showing up at the airport not knowing where you’ll land, but knowing you’re in for something unforgettable. <br>

            We want to inspire people to let go of control, embrace surprise, and rediscover the magic of travel.</p>

        <div class="ourhistory">
            <h1>Our history</h1>
            <p>SkySurprise was founded in Stockholm by a small team of travel lovers, adventurers, and dreamers. What started as a fun idea between friends —
                 “what if people booked a flight without knowing the destination?” — 
                quickly turned into a real business as more and more people craved experiences over itineraries. <br>

                Since our first mystery flight in 2021, we’ve sent thousands of curious travelers to places they never expected — and helped create memories they’ll never forget. <br>

            And we’re just getting started. <br>
            Where we’re going next? Well… that’s still a surprise. </p>

        <div class="ourteam">
            <h1>Our team</h1>
            <p>Behind every mystery flight is a group of curious minds with a passion for adventure. Our team is made up of travel experts, creatives, logistics ne
            rds and joy-seekers — all working together with one shared goal: to craft unforgettable experiences where the destination is unknown, but the memories are unforgettable.
            <br>
            We love what we do — and it shows in every flight we plan.</p>
